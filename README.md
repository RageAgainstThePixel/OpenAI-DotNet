### [Authentication](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)

There are 3 ways to provide your API keys, in order of precedence:

> [!WARNING]
> We recommended using the environment variables to load the API key instead of having it hard coded in your source. It is not recommended use this method in production, but only for accepting user credentials, local testing and quick start scenarios.

1. [Pass keys directly with constructor](#pass-keys-directly-with-constructor) :warning:
2. [Load key from configuration file](#load-key-from-configuration-file)
3. [Use System Environment Variables](#use-system-environment-variables)

#### Pass keys directly with constructor

> [!WARNING]
> We recommended using the environment variables to load the API key instead of having it hard coded in your source. It is not recommended use this method in production, but only for accepting user credentials, local testing and quick start scenarios.

```csharp
using var api = new OpenAIClient("sk-apiKey");
```

Or create a `OpenAIAuthentication` object manually

```csharp
using var api = new OpenAIClient(new OpenAIAuthentication("sk-apiKey", "org-yourOrganizationId", "proj_yourProjectId"));
```

#### Load key from configuration file

Attempts to load api keys from a configuration file, by default `.openai` in the current directory, optionally traversing up the directory tree or in the user's home directory.

To create a configuration file, create a new text file named `.openai` and containing the line:

> [!NOTE]
> Organization and project id entries are optional.

##### Json format

```json
{
  "apiKey": "sk-aaaabbbbbccccddddd",
  "organizationId": "org-yourOrganizationId",
  "projectId": "proj_yourProjectId"
}
```

##### Deprecated format

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-aaaabbbbbccccddddd
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID=org-yourOrganizationId
OPENAI_PROJECT_ID=proj_yourProjectId
```

You can also load the configuration file directly with known path by calling static methods in `OpenAIAuthentication`:

- Loads the default `.openai` config in the specified directory:

```csharp
using var api = new OpenAIClient(OpenAIAuthentication.LoadFromDirectory("path/to/your/directory"));
```

- Loads the configuration file from a specific path. File does not need to be named `.openai` as long as it conforms to the json format:

```csharp
using var api = new OpenAIClient(OpenAIAuthentication.LoadFromPath("path/to/your/file.json"));
```

#### Use System Environment Variables

Use your system's environment variables specify an api key and organization to use.

- Use `OPENAI_API_KEY` for your api key.
- Use `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID` to specify an organization.
- Use `OPENAI_PROJECT_ID` to specify a project.

```csharp
using var api = new OpenAIClient(OpenAIAuthentication.LoadFromEnv());
```

### Handling OpenAIClient and HttpClient Lifecycle

`OpenAIClient` implements `IDisposable` to manage the lifecycle of the resources it uses, including `HttpClient`. When you initialize `OpenAIClient`, it will create an internal `HttpClient` instance if one is not provided. This internal `HttpClient` is disposed of when `OpenAIClient` is disposed of. If you provide an external `HttpClient` instance to `OpenAIClient`, you are responsible for managing its disposal.

- If `OpenAIClient` creates its own `HttpClient`, it will also take care of disposing it when you dispose `OpenAIClient`.
- If an external `HttpClient` is passed to `OpenAIClient`, it will not be disposed of by `OpenAIClient`. You must manage the disposal of the `HttpClient` yourself.

Please ensure to appropriately dispose of `OpenAIClient` to release resources timely and to prevent any potential memory or resource leaks in your application.

Typical usage with an internal `HttpClient`:

```csharp
using var api = new OpenAIClient();
```

Custom `HttpClient` (which you must dispose of yourself):

```csharp
using var customHttpClient = new HttpClient();
// set custom http client properties here
var api = new OpenAIClient(client: customHttpClient);
```

### [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai)

You can also choose to use Microsoft's Azure OpenAI deployments as well.

You can find the required information in the Azure Playground by clicking the `View Code` button and view a URL like this:

```markdown
https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment-id}/chat/completions?api-version={api-version}
```

- `your-resource-name` The name of your Azure OpenAI Resource.
- `deployment-id` The deployment name you chose when you deployed the model.
- `api-version` The API version to use for this operation. This follows the YYYY-MM-DD format.

To setup the client to use your deployment, you'll need to pass in `OpenAIClientSettings` into the client constructor.

```csharp
var auth = new OpenAIAuthentication("sk-apiKey");
var settings = new OpenAIClientSettings(resourceName: "your-resource-name", deploymentId: "deployment-id", apiVersion: "api-version");
using var api = new OpenAIClient(auth, settings);
```

#### [Azure Active Directory Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference#authentication)

[Authenticate with MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet) as usual and get access token, then use the access token when creating your `OpenAIAuthentication`. Then be sure to set useAzureActiveDirectory to true when creating your `OpenAIClientSettings`.

[Tutorial: Desktop app that calls web APIs: Acquire a token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-desktop-acquire-token?tabs=dotnet)

```csharp
// get your access token using any of the MSAL methods
var accessToken = result.AccessToken;
var auth = new OpenAIAuthentication(accessToken);
var settings = new OpenAIClientSettings(resourceName: "your-resource", deploymentId: "deployment-id", apiVersion: "api-version", useActiveDirectoryAuthentication: true);
using var api = new OpenAIClient(auth, settings);
```

### [OpenAI API Proxy](OpenAI-DotNet-Proxy/Readme.md)

[![NuGet version (OpenAI-DotNet-Proxy)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/OpenAI-DotNet-Proxy.svg?label=OpenAI-DotNet-Proxy&logo=nuget)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenAI-DotNet-Proxy/)

Using either the [OpenAI-DotNet](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/OpenAI-DotNet) or [com.openai.unity](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/com.openai.unity) packages directly in your front-end app may expose your API keys and other sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to set up an intermediate API that makes requests to OpenAI on behalf of your front-end app. This library can be utilized for both front-end and intermediary host configurations, ensuring secure communication with the OpenAI API.

#### Front End Example

In the front end example, you will need to securely authenticate your users using your preferred OAuth provider. Once the user is authenticated, exchange your custom auth token with your API key on the backend.

Follow these steps:

1. Setup a new project using either the [OpenAI-DotNet](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/OpenAI-DotNet) or [com.openai.unity](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/com.openai.unity) packages.
2. Authenticate users with your OAuth provider.
3. After successful authentication, create a new `OpenAIAuthentication` object and pass in the custom token with the prefix `sess-`.
4. Create a new `OpenAIClientSettings` object and specify the domain where your intermediate API is located.
5. Pass your new `auth` and `settings` objects to the `OpenAIClient` constructor when you create the client instance.

Here's an example of how to set up the front end:

```csharp
var authToken = await LoginAsync();
var auth = new OpenAIAuthentication($"sess-{authToken}");
var settings = new OpenAIClientSettings(domain: "api.your-custom-domain.com");
using var api = new OpenAIClient(auth, settings);
```

This setup allows your front end application to securely communicate with your backend that will be using the OpenAI-DotNet-Proxy, which then forwards requests to the OpenAI API. This ensures that your OpenAI API keys and other sensitive information remain secure throughout the process.

#### Back End Example

In this example, we demonstrate how to set up and use `OpenAIProxy` in a new ASP.NET Core web app. The proxy server will handle authentication and forward requests to the OpenAI API, ensuring that your API keys and other sensitive information remain secure.

1. Create a new [ASP.NET Core minimal web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0) project.
2. Add the OpenAI-DotNet nuget package to your project.
    - Powershell install: `Install-Package OpenAI-DotNet-Proxy`
    - Dotnet install: `dotnet add package OpenAI-DotNet-Proxy`
    - Manually editing .csproj: `<PackageReference Include="OpenAI-DotNet-Proxy" />`
3. Create a new class that inherits from `AbstractAuthenticationFilter` and override the `ValidateAuthentication` method. This will implement the `IAuthenticationFilter` that you will use to check user session token against your internal server.
4. In `Program.cs`, create a new proxy web application by calling `OpenAIProxy.CreateWebApplication` method, passing your custom `AuthenticationFilter` as a type argument.
5. Create `OpenAIAuthentication` and `OpenAIClientSettings` as you would normally with your API keys, org id, or Azure settings.

```csharp
public partial class Program
{
    private class AuthenticationFilter : AbstractAuthenticationFilter
    {
        public override async Task ValidateAuthenticationAsync(IHeaderDictionary request)
        {
            await Task.CompletedTask; // remote resource call to verify token

            // You will need to implement your own class to properly test
            // custom issued tokens you've setup for your end users.
            if (!request.Authorization.ToString().Contains(TestUserToken))
            {
                throw new AuthenticationException("User is not authorized");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var auth = OpenAIAuthentication.LoadFromEnv();
        var settings = new OpenAIClientSettings(/* your custom settings if using Azure OpenAI */);
        using var openAIClient = new OpenAIClient(auth, settings);
        OpenAIProxy.CreateWebApplication<AuthenticationFilter>(args, openAIClient).Run();
    }
}
```

Once you have set up your proxy server, your end users can now make authenticated requests to your proxy api instead of directly to the OpenAI API. The proxy server will handle authentication and forward requests to the OpenAI API, ensuring that your API keys and other sensitive information remain secure.

### [Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models)

All outputs must be submitted in a single request.

> [!NOTE]
> See [Create Thread and Run Streaming](#create-thread-and-run-streaming) example on how to stream tool output events.

```csharp
using var api = new OpenAIClient();
var tools = new List<Tool>
{
    // Use a predefined tool
    Tool.Retrieval, Tool.CodeInterpreter,
    // Or create a tool from a type and the name of the method you want to use for function calling
    Tool.GetOrCreateTool(typeof(WeatherService), nameof(WeatherService.GetCurrentWeatherAsync)),
    // Pass in an instance of an object to call a method on it
    Tool.GetOrCreateTool(api.ImagesEndPoint, nameof(ImagesEndpoint.GenerateImageAsync)),
    // Define func<,> callbacks
    Tool.FromFunc("name_of_func", () => { /* callback function */ }),
    Tool.FromFunc<T1,T2,TResult>("func_with_multiple_params", (t1, t2) => { /* logic that calculates return value */ return tResult; })
};
var assistantRequest = new CreateAssistantRequest(tools: tools, instructions: "You are a helpful weather assistant. Use the appropriate unit based on geographical location.");
var testAssistant = await api.AssistantsEndpoint.CreateAssistantAsync(assistantRequest);
var run = await testAssistant.CreateThreadAndRunAsync("I'm in Kuala-Lumpur, please tell me what's the temperature now?");
// waiting while run is Queued and InProgress
run = await run.WaitForStatusChangeAsync();

// Invoke all of the tool call functions and return the tool outputs.
var toolOutputs = await testAssistant.GetToolOutputsAsync(run.RequiredAction.SubmitToolOutputs.ToolCalls);

foreach (var toolOutput in toolOutputs)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"tool call output: {toolOutput.Output}");
}
// submit the tool outputs
run = await run.SubmitToolOutputsAsync(toolOutputs);
// waiting while run in Queued and InProgress
run = await run.WaitForStatusChangeAsync();
var messages = await run.ListMessagesAsync();

foreach (var message in messages.Items.OrderBy(response => response.CreatedAt))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{message.Role}: {message.PrintContent()}");
}
```

##### [Thread Structured Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs)

Structured Outputs is the evolution of JSON mode. While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherence.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - When using JSON mode, always instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string "JSON" does not appear somewhere in the context.
> - The JSON in the message the model returns may be partial (i.e. cut off) if `finish_reason` is length, which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the token limit. To guard against this, check `finish_reason` before parsing the response.

First define the structure of your responses. These will be used as your schema.
These are the objects you'll deserialize to, so be sure to use standard Json object models.

```csharp
public class MathResponse
{
    [JsonInclude]
    [JsonPropertyName("steps")]
    public IReadOnlyList<MathStep> Steps { get; private set; }

    [JsonInclude]
    [JsonPropertyName("final_answer")]
    public string FinalAnswer { get; private set; }
}

public class MathStep
{
    [JsonInclude]
    [JsonPropertyName("explanation")]
    public string Explanation { get; private set; }

    [JsonInclude]
    [JsonPropertyName("output")]
    public string Output { get; private set; }
}
```

To use, simply specify the `MathResponse` type as a generic constraint in either `CreateAssistantAsync`, `CreateRunAsync`, or `CreateThreadAndRunAsync`.

```csharp
var assistant = await OpenAIClient.AssistantsEndpoint.CreateAssistantAsync<MathResponse>(
    new CreateAssistantRequest(
        name: "Math Tutor",
        instructions: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
        model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"));
ThreadResponse thread = null;

try
{
    async Task StreamEventHandler(IServerSentEvent @event)
    {
        try
        {
            switch (@event)
            {
                case MessageResponse message:
                    if (message.Status != MessageStatus.Completed)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine(@event.ToJsonString());
                        break;
                    }

                    var mathResponse = message.FromSchema<MathResponse>();

                    for (var i = 0; i < mathResponse.Steps.Count; i++)
                    {
                        var step = mathResponse.Steps[i];
                        Console.WriteLine($"Step {i}: {step.Explanation}");
                        Console.WriteLine($"Result: {step.Output}");
                    }

                    Console.WriteLine($"Final Answer: {mathResponse.FinalAnswer}");
                    break;
                default:
                    Console.WriteLine(@event.ToJsonString());
                    break;
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(e);
            throw;
        }

        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    var run = await assistant.CreateThreadAndRunAsync("how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23", StreamEventHandler);
    thread = await run.GetThreadAsync();
    run = await run.WaitForStatusChangeAsync();
    Console.WriteLine($"Created thread and run: {run.ThreadId} -> {run.Id} -> {run.CreatedAt}");
    var messages = await thread.ListMessagesAsync();

    foreach (var response in messages.Items.OrderBy(response => response.CreatedAt))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{response.Role}: {response.PrintContent()}");
    }
}
finally
{
    await assistant.DeleteAsync(deleteToolResources: thread == null);

#### [Chat Json Mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/json-mode)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - When using JSON mode, always instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string "JSON" does not appear somewhere in the context.
> - The JSON in the message the model returns may be partial (i.e. cut off) if `finish_reason` is length, which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the token limit. To guard against this, check `finish_reason` before parsing the response.
> - JSON mode will not guarantee the output matches any specific schema, only that it is valid and parses without errors.

```csharp
var messages = new List<Message>
{
    new Message(Role.System, "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON."),
    new Message(Role.User, "Who won the world series in 2020?"),
};
var chatRequest = new ChatRequest(messages, Model.GPT4o, responseFormat: ChatResponseFormat.Json);
var response = await api.ChatEndpoint.GetCompletionAsync(chatRequest);

foreach (var choice in response.Choices)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"[{choice.Index}] {choice.Message.Role}: {choice} | Finish Reason: {choice.FinishReason}");
}

response.GetUsage();
```
