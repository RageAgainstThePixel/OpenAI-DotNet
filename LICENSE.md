This library is licensed CC-0, in the public domain.  You can use it for whatever you want, publicly or privately, without worrying about permission or licensing or whatever.  It's just a wrapper around the OpenAI API, so you still need to get access to OpenAI from them directly.  I am not affiliated with OpenAI and this library is not endorsed by them, I just have beta access and wanted to make a C# library to access it more easily.  Hopefully others find this useful as well.  Feel free to open a PR if there's anything you want to contribute.
