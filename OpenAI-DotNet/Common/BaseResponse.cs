        /*
        * Regex Notes:
        *  The gist of this regex is that it is searching for "timestamp segments", e.g. 1m or 144ms.
        *  Each segment gets matched into its respective named capture group, from which we further parse out the 
        *  digits. This allows us to take the string 6m45s99ms and insert the integers into a 
        *  TimeSpan object for easier use.
        *
        *  Regex Performance Notes, against 100k randomly generated timestamps:
        *  Average performance: 0.0003ms
        *  Best case: 0ms
        *  Worst Case: 15ms
        *  Total Time: 30ms
        *
        *  Inconsequential compute time
